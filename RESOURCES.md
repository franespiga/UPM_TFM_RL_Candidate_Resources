* [Coursera Reinforcement Learning specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/reinforcement-learning?): applied RL using python, with Sutton & Barto as the content reference. 
* [Coursera Discrete Optimization Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/discrete-optimization?): really good introduction to the type of problems that we aim to solve and bridges the gap between Operations Research and data-driven modern approaches all using Python.
